  They may not have secured the win, but the Shanghai Dragons played their best
  game ever last week, narrowly losing game 5 to the Fusion. That alone is
  plenty to get excited about!


  But that's also not all. The penultimate week of Stage 3 turned out to be one
  of the best of the season, Pine demonstrates his deadly precision in and out
  of the game, and Poko also has, er, hidden talents. And it wouldn't be
  Overwatch League without some good, old-fashioned player harassment!

They may not have secured the win, but the Shanghai Dragons played their best game ever last week, narrowly losing game 5 to the Fusion. That alone is plenty to get excited about!

But that's also not all. The penultimate week of Stage 3 turned out to be one of the best of the season, Pine demonstrates his deadly precision in and out of the game, and Poko also has, er, hidden talents. And it wouldn't be Overwatch League without some good, old-fashioned player harassment!

The Uprising have firmly secured their spot in the playoffs this upcoming weekend, but will they be able to rally once more against the Excelsior if the two teams get back in the fight? Find out what we expect to see, and let us know just how wrong (or right) you think we are!

This episode was produced by Eric Saupe and Ashton Herrmann, and audio editing and mixing were performed by Ashton. You can find us at mekacast.com for show notes, blog posts, and links to our social media channels and Discord.
