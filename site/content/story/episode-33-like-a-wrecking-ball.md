Overwatch is getting its first playable rodent! Wait, second? Does Junkrat count? Either way, Hammond (i.e. Wrecking Ball) is here, and he's very different than most of us were expecting.

Along with our newest hero, there's a whole payload of other patch notes to unpack. Endorsements and LFG are both live, and the community is already seeing the impact; Symmetra's a killing machine; and it looks most of our DPS heroes are getting buffs to their range on the PTR.

We also discuss some OWL controversy and a peculiar case of a Korean hacker who might actually be going to jail after making six figures helping Overwatch players cheat.

We're coming in like a wrecking ball; come join us!
