OWL 2018, Stage 2 has come to an explosive end, and this episode's all about the excitement of the final games leading up to the title matches and the surprising final showdown between the Fusion and the Excelsior.

We also talk "avoid as teammate," Brigitte on standard servers along with a slew of balance changes that just hit the PTR, including nerfs to D.Va, Zenyatta, and Moira.

This episode was produced by Eric Saupe and Ashton Herrmann, and audio editing was performed by Ashton. You can find us at mekacast.com for show notes, blog posts, or links to our social media channels.
