It's 2018, and the MEKAcast is back and ready to boost our APM! In our last episode before the Overwatch League's first-ever season kicks off, we take a look at Team Venus, an all-women competitive Overwatch team, discuss the death of the APEX League, and weigh the pros and cons of Mercy's latest nerf on the PTR, her most significant one to date. Finally, we dive into the Fusion and Dragons, the final two teams in the league, and just in time for the season!

Back into the fray!
