This one's all about the 2018 quarterfinals Philadelphia's surprising triumph over Boston, the Gladiator's 5000 IQ play (and their ultimate defeat), and a Battle Mercy who racks up a 3k in damage.

Finally, we make our predictions for next week's semifinals, including Ashton's dream of seeing London and Philly face off in the Grand Finals later this month. Eric guarantees this won't happen.

And yes, I'm writing this well after the semifinals have already taken place. Hindsight's 20/20.
