  Since she entered the game, Brigitte's been a polarizing force for Overwatch,
  and few heroes could claim to have disrupted the meta as much as she has, but

Since she entered the game, Brigitte's been a polarizing force for Overwatch, and few heroes could claim to have disrupted the meta as much as she has, but is she really "the worst?" We don't think so, but we'd love to hear what you think!

In this short episode, we also discuss Rascal's new home, the top five esports (in terms of gross prize money), the most popular heroes of the season, and pretzels.

This episode was produced by Eric Saupe and Ashton Herrmann, and audio editing and mixing were performed by Ashton. You can find us at mekacast.com for show notes, blog posts, and links to our social media channels and Discord.
