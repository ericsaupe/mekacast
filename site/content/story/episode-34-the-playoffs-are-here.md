  The Overwatch League 2018 season playoffs are finally here, and we can't wait
  to see what happens with this week's quarterfinals. The Fusion face off
  against the Uprising, Eric's personal favorite since the very beginning (and
  we all laughed at him last December). Meanwhile, the Gladiators take on the
  Spitfire in a matchup that's almost too perfect.

The Overwatch League 2018 season playoffs are finally here, and we can't wait to see what happens with this week's quarterfinals. The Fusion face off against the Uprising, Eric's personal favorite since the very beginning (and we all laughed at him last December). Meanwhile, the Gladiators take on the Spitfire in a matchup that's almost too perfect.

The teams will a best-of-three series of games, each of which are themselves a best-of-three map set, but who will we see go on to face the Gladiators and Excelsior next week?

Meanwhile, the Queen of the Junkers has gone missing on Junkertown, and loremaster Michael Chu is being rather vague about the whole thing; Wrecking Ball gets his first nerf; and Saebyeolbe is sick of Widowmaker.

We've been waiting a long time for this week!
