  In this very special episode of the MEKAcast, Ashton and Eric meet, IN PERSON,
  to discuss stage 2, week 2 of OWL 2018, which proved to be one of the more
  disappointing weeks of the season thus far. We also talk Effect's half-time
  mechanics practice, all the buff's in last week's major patch (welcome back to
  the meta, Sombra!), and Overwatch's latest hero, Brigitte Lindholm!
