  We're two weeks into stage 4 of the 2018 Overwatch League seasons, and we're
  already surprised by what we're seeing. The Boston Uprising, who couldn't lose
  last stage, are struggling to find a win while the Dallas Fuel are playing
  better than we've ever seen them before. And, would you look at that?
  Surefour's racked up the league's first-ever Symmetra play time.

We're two weeks into stage 4 of the 2018 Overwatch League seasons, and we're already surprised by what we're seeing. The Boston Uprising, who couldn't lose last stage, are struggling to find a win while the Dallas Fuel are playing better than we've ever seen them before. And, would you look at that? Surefour's racked up the league's first-ever Symmetra play time.

Not only that, but we dive into the Anniversary event, which is now underway and totally awesome, along with latest patch notes, including a significant buff to Ana.

We also discuss last week's news headlines such as Geguri revealing that the Dragons have been without their interpreter this entire stage so far, the Spitfire designating that four of their players are "inactive," and Void's first game with the Gladiators.

The first season is nearly over; won't you join us as we see this thing out?
