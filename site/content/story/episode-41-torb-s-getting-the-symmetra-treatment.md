Just as we started to wonder what happened to Jeff Kaplan's developer updates, he arrives, bringing nerfs and reworks with him. Brigitte continues to get tweaked while Pharah gets rebalanced towards higher-skilled players. Torb gets a massive rework, and the devs promise they don't hate tanks.

We also now know the top 8 brackets for the World Cup finals at Blizzcon, and we're stoked to see who--if anyone--will be able to give returning champions. South Korea, a run for their money. November can't come soon enough.
