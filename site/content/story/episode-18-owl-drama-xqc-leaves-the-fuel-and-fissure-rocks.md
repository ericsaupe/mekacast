It's been an eventful week in the Overwatch League since our episode! Shanghai and London both part ways with their head coaches, xQc leaves the Fuel following even more controversy, Soe receives death threats for her tweet on International Women's Day, a Twitch moderator posts revenge porn of a former Blizzard employee mid-stream on, and so much more.

But it's not all bad! We also got to see the Gladiators—bolstered by former London tank, Fissure—overthrow the Spitfire, and the Mayhem took their first stage 2 win off the Fuel.

It's not all bad, guys. You gotta believe!
