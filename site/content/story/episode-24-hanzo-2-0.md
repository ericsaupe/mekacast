How much can your world change in just one week? Dallas has fired their head coach, Hanzo's scatter arrow is no more (at least on the PTR), Ben Brode has left Blizzard, and it turns out that Canadian bowling is nothing like it is in the states!

In this episode, we discuss all of these massive revelations and more, like the whole slew of hero nerfs that just hit the PTR and the surprising league standings for not only stage 3, but the entire first OWL season.

Guess we really do have to see the world for what it could be, huh?

This episode was produced by Eric Saupe and Ashton Herrmann, and audio editing and mixing was performed by Ashton. You can find us at mekacast.com for show notes, blog posts, and links to our social media channels and Discord.
