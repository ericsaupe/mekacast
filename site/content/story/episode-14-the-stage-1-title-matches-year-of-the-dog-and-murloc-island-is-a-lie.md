Stage 1 of the league's inaugural season has gone out with a bang! Join us as we talk about our favorite moments from week 5 including the Valiant's upset against the Dynasty, Houston's surprising rise to the title matches, and the London Spitfire's prize-winning endurance.

We also discuss Nate Nanzer's teased improvements to Stage 2's scheduling, Geguri's new OWL team, Ark and Nus's emotional display of good sportsmanship, and the deeply upsetting lie that is Murloc Island.

We're on fire!
