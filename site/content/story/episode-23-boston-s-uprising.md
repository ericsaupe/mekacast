  Stage 3 of the Overwatch League's first season is shaping up to be a
  surprising one. The Boston Uprising have terminated the contract of
  DreamKazper after last week's shocking allegations, but losing their top DPS
  player doesn't stop them from ending NYXL's win streak. New York, who have
  averaged just one loss per stage, are currently ranked third for the stage.

New York, who have averaged just one loss per stage, are currently ranked third for the stage.

In this episode, we also talk about the new Archives event, Amelia Mary-Justice's interesting take on how Overwatch's failing ranked system is putting the esport in jeapordy, and Hydtration's "tip" about the best time to use Genji's ult.
