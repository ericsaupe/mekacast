  With just one week left in the regular season, Stage 4 is shaping up to be one
  of the most surprising ones we've seen yet. The Excelsior have literally
  doubled their number of losses this stage, which means they've lost two games,
  while the teams from LA have dominated. One surprise that we probably should
  have seen coming, however, was that Shanghai failed to nab a win yet again.

With just one week left in the regular season, Stage 4 is shaping up to be one of the most surprising ones we've seen yet. The Excelsior have literally doubled their number of losses this stage, which means they've lost two games, while the teams from LA have dominated. One surprise that we probably should have seen coming, however, was that Shanghai failed to nab a win yet again.

We also discuss the massive changes that hit the PTR this past week, including Symmetra's significant reworking and buffs to Doomfist and Orisa. Oh, and remember that updated version of Horizon Lunar Colony that leaked a while back? Yeah, it's live now.

With just one week left in the season, we're looking forward to the playoffs and eager to learn who our top six teams will be for the year. Can Seoul manage to climb back up to a spot in the finals? Will Valiant lead their division? We can't wait to find out!
