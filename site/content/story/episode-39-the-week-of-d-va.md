  The MEKAcast is back after Ashton's trip to Cape Town, South Africa! While we
  were gone, D.Va finally got her very own animated short that at least briefly
  mentioned the other members of the MEKA squad. Since they're the namesake for
  this show, it's kind-of a big deal.

The MEKAcast is back after Ashton's trip to Cape Town, South Africa! While we were gone, D.Va finally got her very own animated short that at least briefly mentioned the other members of the MEKA squad. Since they're the namesake for this show, it's kind-of a big deal.

We talk about the new map, Busan, as well as the Nano Cola challenge. We also review what happened during the All-Star Weekend. Well, Eric does for Ashton's (and your) benefit.

Finally, World Cup season is in full-swing, and we're quickly approaching the finals at Blizzcon this November. Is your team going to make the cut?

This episode was produced by Eric Saupe and Ashton Herrmann, and audio editing and mixing were performed by Ashton. You can find us at mekacast.com for show notes, blog posts, and links to our social media channels and Discord.
