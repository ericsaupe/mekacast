  The title matches for Stage 2 are just one week away, and it's anybody's guess
  who will be taking the third spot in the title matches. In this episode, we
  talk about last week's wonderful Overwatch League showing, Florida's
  surprising wins, Brigitte hitting standard servers, and Shanghai temporarily
  losing two of its best players. Oh, and so much more.
