The MEKAcast is back after a short hiatus, and we're ready to talk about the upcoming All-Star weekend, which is shaping up to be a lot more fun than either of us had expected beforehand.

We also cover the latest Summer Games event, some sweet new skins, and some early 2019 OWL season news and rumors.

We won't be recording for a couple of weeks, but we'll be back to our regular schedule as the pre-season begins to warm up again. Stay tuned, and let us know what you think of the show at MEKAcast.com!

This episode was produced by Eric Saupe and Ashton Herrmann, and audio editing and mixing were performed by Ashton. You can find us at mekacast.com for show notes, blog posts, and links to our social media channels and Discord.
