Week 3 of the Overwatch League proved to be the best one yet with a series of upsets and 5-map sets! Join us as we review our favorite moments, including Eric's first live attendance of an OWL match.

We also talk Blizzworld, Profit's middle finger fiasco, and Winston's Map. Oh, and did you know that you can earn in-game tokens for OWL skins just by linking your Battle.net account to Twitch? Neither did we until now, and we'll tell you how to do it!

We're just getting warmed up, people!
