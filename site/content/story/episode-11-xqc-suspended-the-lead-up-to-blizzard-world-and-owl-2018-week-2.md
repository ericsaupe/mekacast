  This week on the MEKAcast, Ashton and Eric talk about more xQc drama after he
  gets fined and suspended from the remainder of Stage 1. So far, the league
  seems to be a success with viewers, and even YouPorn is saying they noticed a
  dip in traffic during opening week. Also, it looks like at least one pro
  actually enjoys playing Mercy.
