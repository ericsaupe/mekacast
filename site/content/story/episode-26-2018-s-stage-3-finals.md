Stage 3 has come to its close, and while the title matches themselves weren't quite as dramatic as we might have hoped, the last week leading up to it was one of the best we've seen in the league yet!

Boston managed to become the first team to ever go undefeated in a stage, Shanghai stole a map point off the Excelsior, and much more added to a very dramatic conclusion to the stage.

But the most shocking news came out right after the title matches, with not one but two team major team coach changes announced completely out of left field.

We also discuss Brigitte's nerfs, Blizzard's agonizingly slow process for iteration, and Ana's unexpected but phenomenal buff.

Come join us as we take one last look at stage 3 of the 2018 season before we look forward to the stage 4 and the upcoming season playoffs!

This episode was produced by Eric Saupe and Ashton Herrmann, and audio editing and mixing were performed by Ashton. You can find us at mekacast.com for show notes, blog posts, and links to our social media channels and Discord.
