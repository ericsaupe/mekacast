Stage 3 is here, and the OWL drama keeps coming! In this episode, we talk about Widowmaker duel stats, EQO's suspension for account boosting, and the shocking allegations levied against the Uprising's DreamKazper that he solicited nude pictures from an underage fan.

We also chat about behind the scenes development news, like the fact that D.Va makes everything hard for the devs, and she wouldn't have it any other way. We talk Archives event skins, too, and finally recap the first week of stage 3, which saw Geguri's thrilling debut with the Dragons, even if the team couldn't muster their first victory.

Of course, she's just getting warmed up.

This episode was produced by Eric Saupe and Ashton Herrmann, and audio editing was performed by Ashton. You can find us at mekacast.com for show notes, blog posts, or links to our social media channels.
