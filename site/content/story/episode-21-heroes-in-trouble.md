In our break between stage 2 and stage 3 of the 2018 season of Overwatch League, we discuss the final player trades and rumors, Geguri's upcoming debut, whether or not the Shanghai Dragons can turn the season around, and the announcement of the 2018 Overwatch World Cup.

There aren't any patch notes this time around, but we have gotten our first teases of the next seasonal event, which has been renamed the Archives event from the previously called Uprising event of last year.

We then take a look at the heroes with the least playtime in the league thus far and consider what it is about each of them that makes them unviable within the current meta.

Stage 3 is almost here! Are you ready? What are your hopes and predictions?

This episode was produced by Eric Saupe and Ashton Herrmann, and audio editing was performed by Ashton. You can find us at mekacast.com for show notes, blog posts, or links to our social media channels.
