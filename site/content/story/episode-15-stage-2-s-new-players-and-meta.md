  Stage 2 is nearly upon us and mid-season player trades and signings are in
  full swing. In Episode 15, we discuss the new meta leading into the next stage
  of OWL 2018, changing team rosters (including Geguri), and a new, more
  consistent weekly schedule for match times. We also talk Sombra and Mei buffs
  on the PTR and Lucio's wall ride nerf... in Capture the Flag.
