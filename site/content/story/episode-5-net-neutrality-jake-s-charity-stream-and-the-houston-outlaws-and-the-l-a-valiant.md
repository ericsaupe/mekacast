  In Episode 5 of the MEKAcast, we discuss one-tricking, net neutrality, and
  JAKE's charity stream, which was plagued by throwers. Moira gets an
  unintentional nerf on the PTR, and Doomfist is plagued by over 18 very
  well-documented (thanks to a Reddit user) bugs. Finally, we deep-dive into the
  Houston Outlaws and the L.A. Valiant.
