The break after last week's stage title matches is over, and we're looking forward to the first week of the final stage of the season. Since the top teams from each division will be playing in the playoffs following Stage 4, every game really feels like it counts now.

Before we discuss our predictions for this week's games, we talk first about a surprising Supreme Court ruling that could have a dramatic impact on the esports community. Blizzard continues to make some baffling decisions regarding censorship on Twitch and for the contender's league. And we still don't know what patch the OWL will actually be playing on next week.

We also discuss Effect's planned absence in the following week(s) in light of his recent, troubling comments on Twitter and Twitch. We wish him the best as he takes the time he needs to recover and hopefully get the help he needs, and we'd like to remind our listeners to seek professional help if they, too, are experiencing thoughts of worthlessness and suicide.

This episode was produced by Eric Saupe and Ashton Herrmann, and audio editing and mixing were performed by Ashton. You can find us at mekacast.com for show notes, blog posts, and links to our social media channels and Discord.
