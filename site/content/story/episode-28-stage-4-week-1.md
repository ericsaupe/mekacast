The first week of the last stage of the season just wrapped up, and we've already seen some heartbreaking defeats. Shanghai goes down to the Effect-less Fuel, while Boston fails to muster a win after their perfect stage three record.

On the upside, we also discuss the success of the Pink Mercy skin, xQc's "swatting," the Spitfire's tribute to the royal wedding, and HiRez's latest attempt to steal Blizzard's work (I kid, I kid).

Tune in, and let us know what you think of the show!

This episode was produced by Eric Saupe and Ashton Herrmann, and audio editing and mixing were performed by Ashton. You can find us at mekacast.com for show notes, blog posts, and links to our social media channels and Discord.
