The MEKAcast is back for our 30th episode! Even in the final weeks of this season, Overwatch League continues to surprise us as the Valiant climb to second place in the league, all but guaranteeing a top-of-division placement in the upcoming playoffs. Meanwhile, the Fuel continue to play better than they have all season and Boston suddenly can't buy a win.

In the news, a community favorite player loses his spot on the Danish World Cup team for cheating during the voting period, but Blizzard's transparency on the issue (or lack thereof) leaves much to be desired. And, surprisingly, Blizzard announces their plans to add a whopping six new teams to the league for next season.

There are just two short weeks left in the regular season, and you gotta believe we're going to be here on the edge of our seats for every last game. Come join us!

This episode was produced by Eric Saupe and Ashton Herrmann, and audio editing and mixing were performed by Ashton. You can find us at mekacast.com for show notes, blog posts, and links to our social media channels and Discord.
